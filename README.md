# 🧪 One-Week Junior Developer Trial Project Scope: Simple Task Management Application


## ✅ Needed to be done:
External packages, gitignore always needed, taskService layer and test for that, exception handling important

---

This is an excellent idea for helping your junior developer explore different paths!  
A one-week scope needs to be **challenging but achievable**, focusing on **fundamental concepts** and showcasing **practical application**.  
The goal isn't a production-ready system, but rather a **functional prototype** that demonstrates understanding of the chosen stack.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a basic, functional task management application that allows users to create, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks. This project will serve as a practical exercise to explore a chosen programming language/platform/stack, understand its core concepts, and get a "feel" for the development environment.

---

## ✅ Core Functionality (Minimum Viable Product)

### ✍️ Task Creation
- Input a task description (text)
- Store newly created tasks
- Assign each task a **unique identifier**

### 📋 Task Listing/Viewing
- Display all existing tasks
- Clearly show completed vs. incomplete tasks

### ✔️ Task Completion
- Mechanism to mark task as "completed"
- Reflect this in task listing

### ❌ Task Deletion
- Allow users to remove tasks from the list

## 🧠 Technical Requirements & Learning Objectives

### 🧩 Chosen Stack/Language

- Language: Java
- Framework: 
- (Optional) Database or storage solution: Json file


- **Frontend**  
  Focus: Client-side logic, component-based development, and local storage

- **Backend** Java
  Focus: Server-side logic, API development, and database interaction

- **Fullstack** (a simplified hybrid approach)  
  Most challenging for one week, so use a lightweight setup

---

### 💾 Data Persistence

- Json file-based storage to keep it simple
- Learn serialization, deserialization, and basic CRUD operations

---

### 🖥️ UI (if applicable)

- Just a simple JavaFx GUI 
- Maybe later a web-based UI using a framework like Spring Boot

---

### 🔁 Version Control

- Using Git for source control
- GitHub (public) repository ➡️ https://github.com/mpatrikik/SimpleTaskManagementApplication for code sharing

---

### 🧱 Code Structure & Readability

- Organize code with appropriate **file structure**
- Add basic **comments** to explain non-obvious logic
- Follow **language-specific coding conventions**

---

## 📦 Deliverables by End of Week

- ✅ **Working Application**: Implements all core functionalities
- 📂 **Source Code**: Publicly accessible Git repository
- 📝 **README.md File** including:
  - Project title and description
  - Chosen language/framework/stack
  - Setup and run instructions
  - Design choices and encountered challenges
  - Key learnings from the week
  - Potential future improvements

- 🎥 **Brief Demo (Optional but Recommended)**:  
  Short video/screenshare or walkthrough explaining the app and learnings

---

## 🧭 Guidance for the Junior Developer

- **Focus on Fundamentals**:  
  Syntax, data structures, control flow, basic libraries

- **Embrace Documentation**:  
  Read the official docs for your chosen tools

- **Utilize Resources**:  
  Tutorials, forums (Stack Overflow), and AI tools

- **Manage Time Well**:  
  Break problems into small steps. Partial completion with understanding is better than messy, rushed work.

- **Ask Questions**:  
  Asking for help shows engagement, not weakness

- **Reflect and Document**:  
  Use the README to tell the story of what you learned and struggled with

---

## 📊 Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**:  
  Does the app meet core MVP requirements?

- **Understanding**:  
  Does the dev show basic grasp of the chosen language/stack?

- **Problem-Solving**:  
  How did they tackle challenges?

- **Code Quality**:  
  Is the code reasonably clean and understandable for a junior level?

- **Lear**
